    "bio": "With a rich mix of software, business, design, and a sharp eye for details, I find it my ultimate joy to create elegant, meaningful, and intuitive software solutions with the end-user in mind.<br><br>I have <strong>+7 years of software development experience,</strong> making mobile and web applications. I started building native iOS apps back then, when it was iOS 6 and Xcode 4, and have been doing that onto the latest SDK now, in the middle I did some PHP (Laravel framework), and Appcelerator Titanium (Mobile Cross-platform), and Flutter projects.<br><br>I’m a computers engineering graduate with a Very-Good BSc. degree (ranked class 3rd). I also just got my MBA degree with a GPA of 3.9.<br><br>I have always invested time and effort in core skills for building software and this approach has seen me pick up new skills quickly and succeed on challenging projects many times.<br><br>Over the last two years, I have started diversifying my technical skills. I did some web projects and also some Flutter projects, this has exposed me to many other tools that made me enjoy the development process even more. I enjoy all the challenges this industry offers; delivery, leadership, technology, customer satisfaction, innovation, and ongoing learning.<br><br><strong>This is a portfolio of several mobile and web apps I have worked on. My experience goes much further than that with experience as a freelance software developer, managing end-to-end project analysis, launching, and maintenance.</strong>",
